## Introduction and Explanation of the Project

Managing waste efficiently has become one of the major challenges for modern cities. With the growing population and increasing amounts of garbage being produced every day, there is a clear need for smarter, more automated systems to handle waste collection, sorting, and prediction. Most existing systems rely heavily on manual processes—whether it's sorting recyclable materials or scheduling garbage pickups without real data on waste levels. This often leads to inefficient use of resources, increased costs, and missed opportunities for recycling and environmental sustainability.

This project aims to build a Smart Waste Management System using artificial intelligence techniques. The goal is to automatically classify the waste based on images, understand where and how much waste is being dumped across a city, and use this information to optimize how waste is handled over time and across locations.

## What This Project Does (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Waste Classification Using Images

The first step is identifying whether the waste is recyclable or non-recyclable. For this, a convolutional neural network model (ResNet50) was trained on a dataset of labeled images. The dataset is organized into two folders—'recyclable' and 'non-recyclable'. The model is trained to recognize patterns in the images and predict the correct class. After training, the model achieves an accuracy of 94.7%, which makes it highly reliable for this task.

This process automates what is typically a manual task and enables better recycling workflows by sorting the waste at the source.

### 2. Assigning Dump Zones Using Clustering

To manage waste more effectively, it's important to understand where the waste is being dumped. The project uses latitude and longitude data to identify the dump locations. Using the KMeans clustering algorithm, the city is divided into logical zones or clusters. The optimal number of clusters is chosen using the elbow method, and in this case, three zones were found to be ideal.

Each zone represents a geographic area with a similar pattern of waste activity, which helps in organizing collection routes and managing local waste dynamics.

### 3. Predicting Waste Trends with Time-Series Analysis

Once zones are established, the next step is to analyze how much waste is being generated in each zone over time. For this, an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model is used. LSTM is a type of neural network that is well-suited for time-series data because it can remember long-term dependencies and trends.

By feeding the model with historical data on waste quantities per zone, it learns the trend and can predict future waste levels. This helps waste management authorities plan ahead and deploy resources where and when they are needed most.

### 4. Visualizing the Data and Results

Visualizations make the project understandable and usable by non-technical stakeholders:

* Confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy graph show how well the classification model is working.
* Heatmaps display the geographic spread of waste accumulation.
* Time-series plots illustrate how the waste levels change over time for each zone.
* Zone-wise bar plots show the average waste generated in each cluster.

These visual tools make it easy to interpret the system’s behavior and results.

## Why This Project Matters

This project provides an intelligent, end-to-end system that helps cities manage their waste more effectively. By automating waste classification, mapping dumping locations, analyzing waste quantities, and predicting future waste trends, it allows municipal bodies to make data-driven decisions. This leads to better resource management, reduced costs, and an overall improvement in how waste is collected, sorted, and handled.

Instead of relying on fixed garbage truck routes or manual waste inspection, this system adapts to real-world conditions and offers actionable insights, all built using scalable AI technologies.
